# Import Shortcut Rule

Use the `@` alias as a shortcut for importing from the `src` directory. For example, to import a component from `src/components/ToolListItem.vue`, use:

```js
import ToolListItem from '@/components/ToolListItem.vue';
```

This convention should be used for all imports from the `src` directory to improve readability and maintain consistency across the codebase.
