# Lucide Icon Usage Rule

All icons in this project should use the Lucide icon set. Icons should be imported from `lucide-vue-next` and used as Vue components. For example:

```js
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-vue-next';
```

Then in the template:

```vue
<XIcon />
```

Do not use inline SVGs or other icon libraries unless there is a specific exception documented in the codebase.
