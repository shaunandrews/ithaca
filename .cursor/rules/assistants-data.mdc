# Agent Data Source

The list of agents displayed in the app is powered by a static, mocked data array found in [src/data/agents.js](mdc:src/data/agents.js).

- To add, remove, or update agents, edit this file directly.
- Each agent object includes: `id`, `title`, `description`, and a `tools` array (with `icon`, `title`, and optional `subtitle`).
- This data is used in [src/views/Agents.vue](mdc:src/views/Agents.vue) to render the agent list.
