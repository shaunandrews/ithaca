# Vue Project Rule

This project is a Vue.js application. Do **not** suggest or use React, JSX, or React-style code examples. All component and UI code should be written using Vue's syntax and conventions (e.g., `.vue` single-file components, Vue templates, Vue composition/options API, etc.).

If you reference code examples, they must be in Vue format.
