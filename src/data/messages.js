In your [GoDaddy account](https://godaddy.com), go to your domain settings and change the nameservers to:\n\n```\nns1.wordpress.com\nns2.wordpress.com\nns3.wordpress.com\n```\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Come back to your WordPress.com dashboard\n2. Add your domain under **Settings → Domains**\n3. Wait up to **24 hours** for changes to take effect\n\n*Note: DNS propagation can sometimes take longer depending on your location.*\n\nWould you like me to walk you through the step-by-step process?",

WordPress.com has several **built-in tools** to help manage comments and reduce spam.\n\n## Comment Moderation Settings\n\nFirst, go to **Settings → Discussion** in your dashboard. Here you can:\n\n- Require comments to be **approved before appearing**\n- Require users to fill out **name and email**\n- Hold comments with multiple links for moderation\n- Automatically close comments on posts older than a certain number of days\n\n## Spam Protection\n\nFor spam protection, **Akismet** comes free with all WordPress.com sites and automatically filters spam comments. Make sure it's activated under `Plugins → Installed Plugins`.\n\n> **Pro tip:** Akismet learns from your spam/ham decisions, so the more you moderate, the better it gets!\n\n## Managing Comments\n\nYou can also manage comments by going to **Comments** in your dashboard sidebar, where you can:\n\n1. **Approve** legitimate comments\n2. Mark **spam** for suspicious content  \n3. **Delete** unwanted comments\n4. Use **bulk actions** for efficiency\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these settings in more detail?",

Click on your Form block\n2. In the block settings sidebar, find **"Email Settings"**\n3. You can change:\n   • **To email address** (where submissions go)\n   • **From name** (how it appears in your inbox)\n   • **Subject line** (customize the email subject)\n\n**Email format includes:**\n• All form field responses\n• Timestamp of submission\n• Sender\'s information\n• Sometimes IP address (for security)\n\n**Pro tip:** Set up a dedicated email like contact@yourbusiness.com using email forwarding, then point form notifications there for a more professional setup.\n\nDo you need help setting up email forwarding for your business?',

You can always upgrade later if you need more features.

Select **Business plan** and click **"Upgrade"**\n4. Choose billing cycle (monthly or annual for savings)\n5. Complete payment - upgrade is instant!\n\n**What happens immediately:**\n• All Business plan features activate instantly\n• Plugin installation becomes available\n• Storage increases to 200GB\n• Advanced customization tools unlock\n\n**No downtime or disruption:**\n• Your site stays online during upgrade\n• All content and settings remain exactly the same\n• Existing Calendly integration keeps working\n\n**Pro-rated billing:**\n• You only pay the difference for the current billing period\n• Next renewal will be at the new plan rate\n\n**Money-saving tip:**\n• Annual billing gives you 2 months free\n• Business annual = $25 × 10 months = $250 vs $300 monthly\n\n**You can also downgrade later** if you find you don\'t need all the features, though you\'ll lose plugin access.\n\nSo you can definitely start with your current plan + Calendly and upgrade anytime if your needs grow!',

I used reef-safe sunscreen, carried a reusable water bottle, and even chose eco-labeled hotels. Then I learned my 'sustainable' resort was dumping waste into the ocean every night. That wake-up call changed everything about how I travel—and I'm about to share the 7 game-changing discoveries that transformed me from fake eco-tourist to genuine responsible traveler.\"\n\n**Option 2: Problem/Solution**\n\"Want to travel responsibly but tired of articles telling you to 'just offset your flights'? After visiting 30+ countries and making every sustainable travel mistake in the book, I've figured out what actually works (and what's just greenwashing). Here's the honest guide to sustainable tourism that no one else is talking about.\"\n\n**Option 3: Curiosity-driven**\n\"The most 'sustainable' hotel I ever stayed at had no hot water, composting toilets, and cost $300/night. The least sustainable one had every amenity imaginable for $50. Guess which one I'd choose again? The answer might surprise you...\"\n\n**Key changes:**\n• Personal stakes/experience\n• Specific details (numbers, examples)\n• Promise of unique value\n• Conversational tone\n\nWhich style feels most like your voice?",

Here\'s what you need to know:\n\n**Migration Overview:**\n\n**What Transfers Easily:**\n• **Text content** (blog posts, page content)\n• **Images** (with some manual work)\n• **Basic site structure**\n\n**What Requires Recreation:**\n• **Design/layout** (Wix designs don\'t directly transfer)\n• **Custom apps/widgets** (need WordPress equivalents)\n• **Forms** (can rebuild with WordPress.com form blocks)\n\n**Migration Steps:**\n\n**1. Export from Wix**\n• Go to your Wix dashboard\n• Look for **export** or **backup** options\n• Download any available content files\n\n**2. Manual Content Transfer**\n• **Copy/paste text content** from old site to new\n• **Download and re-upload images**\n• **Recreate pages** using WordPress blocks\n\n**3. Choose a WordPress Theme**\n• Pick something similar to your current design\n• Customize to match your brand\n\n**4. Redirect Your Domain**\n• Point your domain to WordPress.com\n• Set up redirects from old URLs (if needed)\n\n**Time Investment:**\n• Small site (5-10 pages): 1-2 days\n• Larger site: 1-2 weeks\n\n**Pro Tip:** Start by recreating your most important pages first (homepage, about, contact).\n\nHow many pages does your current Wix site have?
